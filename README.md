# Compilers
> This repository contains the construction of a basic compiler step by step, along with one interpreter that has been implemented on a robot's control. All topics viewed during the compilers course 2018-2 ESCOM IPN are covered.

#### Why study a compiler construction?
Compiler construction is a microcosm of computer science where things like artificial intelligence, algorithms, computational theory, sistems and computer architectures all come together. Even if compilers are a well study subject, they are constantly changing by adding new features to pose new problems, changing costs and re-engineering of old solutions.

#### What Hoc Compiler Construction covers?
The construction of a Hoc compiler involves:
  - Lexical Analizer
  - Grammar Parsing
  - Semantic Analysis 
  - Translation and simplification
  
All these topics are implemented in the Hoc folders, where an implementation of a Hoc Compiler applied to polynomials has been made. The compiler allows:
  - All basic arithmetic operations (e.g addition, substraction, etc...)
  - Some statistic operations (e.g mean, middle, mode, etc...)
  - Integration and Differentiation over polynomials.
  - All basic components for programming (e.g decisions, cycles, conditions, memory and so more)
